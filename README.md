# Snake

This is a basic snake game implemented in C++. The game reads a map from a file called map.txt and uses simple console-based graphics to display the snake and food items. It was the first project I completed in my introductory cs course during my freshman year. 

## How to Play

The game reads the map from a file called map.txt. Make sure this file is present in the same directory as the executable. Then you will have to input that you are reading from map.txt when the program prompts you. 

The file contains characters representing the game layout:

' ' (space) - empty space

'o' - snake's body

'x' - food item

## Gameplay
~ Use the arrow keys to move the snake

~ The game ends if the snake eats all the food (win), or collides with it's own body (loss).

~ Press the ESC key at any time to quit the game.
